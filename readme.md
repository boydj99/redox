# Redox build

![Alt text](externalFiles/keyboard.jpeg "image")
This is a build of the open source redox split keyboard. I struggle with shoulder and wrist pain using typical staggered keyboards and decided to build a split otholinear board. I want to keep this build on a budget so I source the parts myself and ordered the pcbs using the open source files.
